Bottom Sheet Scaffold has been used in this BottomSheet_Initial Repository.

Two types of Bottom Sheets in Jetpack Compose----
1. ModalBottomSheet: Ideal for focused user interactions, such as forms, selections, or action menus.

2. BottomSheetScaffold: BottomSheetScaffold is a great option for creating persistent, expandable content that sits alongside the main UI. This makes it ideal for scenarios like music player controls, where users might want to interact with the main content while still having quick access to controls.
